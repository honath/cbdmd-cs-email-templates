          If this is your first time using this page, <strong>please read the following before use:</strong><br>
          <br>
          This website serves as a compendium of emails that you, the customer service represenative, can use to communicate with customers quickly and efficiently.<br>
          <strong>Please</strong> remember that these serve as <u>base templates</u> for your emails, and will require some editing and personalization, such as your own signature.<br>
          As a general rule, most of these will have "NAME" in place of the relevant customer's name, and "YOURNAME" in place of where your name should be, but some will have additional fields for you to replace, so keep an eye out for them. The most common will be "ADDRESS", for the customer's shipping address.<br>
          <br>
          Double clicking the placeholder text that is in all caps will select that text, making it quick and easy to replace it! Easy, right?<br>
          <br>
          Good, don't mess it up. Crystal will yell at you, and the customer will be angry.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Once you have read this, feel free to click any of the categories at the top to see the available templates. This disclaimer will disappear.<br>

            Thank you for contacting cbdMD! Those who are long-term medically disabled are eligible to receive a 40% discount on full-price retail orders. To apply, please provide us with a document from a government agency such as an SSDI form that shows you are currently receiving disability benefits. We do not accept Medicaid for this program. This does require that you either have or create an account with us and place all your orders using this account.<br>

              Thank you for contacting cbdMD! Our 3rd party lab results show no detectable amounts of THC, but there's a chance of trace amounts being present. It's important to look into the specific test and acceptable thresholds. We have several athletes and professionals who use our products and are tested daily. Nobody has ever tested positive for THC using our products alone.<br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately I am unable to answer explicitly yes or no, you will need to look into the type of test you are taking. Also, our products have no traces of THC, with THC-free defined as undetectable at the lowest level which is tested using labs.<br>
              <br>
              Please feel free to reach out to us with any further questions or concerns.<br>
